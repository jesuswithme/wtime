Hello everyone.
It's nice to see you.

2
For those who came for the first time,
could you please raise your hands?

3
Wow, it seems there
a number of you. Welcome.

4
For those who came
for the first time,

5
I know some of you might
have come on your own

6
but some of you
have come here

7
because someone kept
asking you to come.

8
You came to listen
as a favor

9
with the condition that
you wouldn't buy anything

since it is a network
marketing company.

11
Thus, I believe
there will be some people

12
who have come
with a closed heart

13
and with no intention of
doing this business.

14
However, you don't
have to worry

15
because we don't let
just anyone do this business.

16
Of course, in terms
of conditions, we don't look at

17
your educational background,
your age, your gender,

18
or your financial situation.
 

19
Even though we are a company
with cosmetic products,

we aren't concerned
about people's appearances.

21
What a relief, right?
 

22
If it was based on looks,
I think only 2 people might pass

23
and everyone else
would fail with this condition.

24
Be rest assured that this company
doesn't look at your appearance.

25
Now you will be introduced
to the products of this company

26
and even hear some
explanations about them.

27
After hearing this
and you think,

28
If I do this business to make money
by selling the products of Atomy,

29
I would only buy them
for the sake of being a contractor."

However, if I didn't
do this business,

31
I don't think I would need
to use these products

32
because I know a place
where I can buy

33
similar products that are better
and more affordable."

34
So there is no point
for me to buy products

35
that are inferior
or more expensive."

36
If this is what you think,
then you shouldn't do this business.

37
Even if you decide to do this business
to make money, you won't be successful

38
because we, as human beings,
have a conscience.

39
If you try to sell products
that even you won't use,

it will be hard to tell
others about them.

41
Although many people say that
doing sales is very challenging,

42
in reality, it shouldn't be
that difficult.

43
People are only saying
that doing sales is hard

44
because they are trying to sell
products that they don't use,

45
that aren't great,
or that are just too expensive.

46
Now let's say you went
to eat at a restaurant

47
that was affordable,
delicious, and clean.

48
After going
to such a restaurant,

49
you would inform the people
around you to go there.

You naturally tell others
about the restaurant

51
even though you are not
getting any compensation

52
for becoming a salesperson
for the restaurant.

53
If you saw a very
interesting movie,

54
you would tell others
to go and watch the film.

55
Although you aren't getting
compensated by the movie theater,

56
you are essentially acting like
a salesperson for them.

57
This means that if you
discover something worthwhile,

58
the act of telling others
and doing the sales itself

59
becomes something
that is fun and exciting.

If you believe
that you would benefit

61
just by using
the products of Atomy,

62
even if you aren't
doing the business

63
or trying to earn
money from it,

64
then you will find that
telling others about it

65
will be fun and exciting,
rather than being difficult.

66
At Atomy,
if you are a registered member,

67
you can get this toothpaste
at a very low price.

68
Is that good
or bad?

69
These come in

and it also contains
something called 'Propolis'.

71
Now you can think of propolis
as a natural antibiotic

72
that can make your mouth
like an aseptic room.

73
Generally speaking, you cannot put
synthetic antibiotics in your mouth.

74
As such, propolis,
which turns a beehive

75
into an aseptic room,
was added to this toothpaste.

76
If you were to go to a pharmacy
to buy toothpaste with propolis,

77
the cost will be, on average,

78
Furthermore, this toothpaste
contains water-soluble propolis.

79
Since propolis is
stored in beeswax

and it doesn't easily
dissolve into water,

81
it has little to almost
no effect on our body.

82
Thus, a water-soluble propolis
was developed,

83
patented, and that technology
was used in this product.

84
The lid is
a one-touch cap type,

85
which isn't usually found
on cheap toothpaste,

86
and it has

87
If this was to cost
less than the pharmacy,

88
is that expensive or affordable?
It's low priced, right?

89
You are able to make
a judgment regarding price.

In terms of quality,
you just have to use it.

91
You can then determine whether
or not you will continue to use it.

92
At Atomy, we don't make
any cosmetic samples.

93
You just have to test it
with the original product.

94
Generally, you can receive
free samples, right?

95
Even though these are
considered to be free samples,

96
who has to cover
the cost for making them?

97
The cosmetic company president
isn't making them with his own money.

98
All the expenses are actually shifted
to the consumers who buy the product.

99
Thus, the price of the cosmetic
products become very high.

As such, Atomy does not
make any samples.

We haven't done in the past,
we aren't going to start now,

nor will we ever be
doing so in the future.

So don't ask
for any samples.

Instead, you should see
how good or bad the product is

by just using
our normal products.

If you don't like
the product after using it,

then just return
the used product

within 3 months of purchase
if possible.

There are some people
who take 1 year to use it

and others who returned
products that have expired.

111
They argue about how I said
that they could return it.

112
Understand that this policy was not
made to be abused by consumers.

113
If you don't like the product
after using it, just return it.

114
The night before
I presented this policy,

115
I couldn't really
fall asleep at all.

116
What would happen

117
The company would have to close down
because it would become bankrupt.

118
Around 4 in the morning,
I made a decision.

119
I thought, "If a company
had that kind of return rate

and the consumers didn't like the product,
then that company shouldn't exist."

121
I should
just go under."

122
Thus, I made the presentation
with the resolve to fail.

123
However, the return rate
of Atomy's cosmetic products

124
is only one-tenth
of the industry average.

125
The return rate is
generally around 3 to 5%.

126
Yet Atomy

127
Actually, it went down

128
As such, Atomy's return rate
isn't even one-tenth of the industry.

129
Even though we don't even supply
free test samples to use

and people are just trying
our normal products directly,

131
the return rate we have is proof
that the consumers are satisfied

132
with the quality and the price
of our products.

133
Normally, you as consumers,
purchase this as a set.

134
Each set contains 6 items and costs
less than most individual products.

135
Is that expensive
or affordable?

136
It's very low price, right?
 

137
So you are getting
6 products in this set

138
for less than the price
of one product.

139
This set of 6 doesn't contain
small sample versions of the product.

Instead, it has 6 normal-sized
regular products.

141
After seeing the milk lotion,
which is our skin lotion,

142
one person came up
to me and said,

143
Do you, as the CEO of Atomy,
know anything about cosmetics?"

144
If you make it this big,
how will people use it all?"

145
How can you get repurchases
and do business like this?"

146
I don't think you know anything
about the cosmetic business."

147
Actually, the president of a skin care
association said this to me.

148
At that time,

149
but now it has been
increased to 135mL.

Although people wondered if I could do

151
I went on to increase the volume
without raising the price.

152
I believe that the Atomy
cosmetic products

153
needs to become a product
for the ordinary people.

154
If you want to become
the product of the masses,

155
it has to be of the highest quality
and sold at the lowest price

156
so that
it wouldn't matter

157
if you bought a few of them
and kept them at your house.

158
There are a lot of
people who think

159
that you need to use
cosmetic products in small amounts.

That was the case when cosmetics
were made with chemicals.

161
However, with natural
cosmetics products,

162
it is better to use it
in bigger amounts.

163
Cosmetic products tend
to be very expensive.

164
If you look at our eye cream,
it is pretty big compared to others.

165
Other companies
sell this in small containers

166
and tell you to put a small
amount around your eyes

167
because the skin around your eyes
is different from your cheek.

168
That's ridiculous
because skin is just skin.

169
The skin around your eyes
is the same as your cheek.

That's why
with our eye cream,

171
you can get a good amount
in your hands and rub it

172
all over your face, neck,
and the back of your hands

173
because you get a lot
for a low price.

174
Cosmetic products need
ingredients to help with absorption

175
but the product also
has to remain in the skin

176
and provide your skin
the protection that it needs.

177
As such, it is essential
to apply a good amount.

178
When you buy 2 sets,
you get 4, so two are free.

179
We look for
various methods

to sell these products
at the lowest prices possible.

181
If you buy 4 sets,
 

182
each set would cost about half
the price of buying just one set.

183
This means that each item is
only one-twelfth the cost.

184
A woman told me that she couldn't
use it because it was too cheap.

185
She used products
that cost $1K each.

186
Since it was so low priced,
she said she couldn't use it.

187
This person who only
used luxury brands

188
bought our products
as a favor for a friend.

189
She then thought, "How can I use
such a cheap product on my face

when I have been only using
the expensive products on my face?"

191
So she applied it
to her behind and her feet.

192
After doing this
for a month,

193
the skin on her behind
and feet got better.

194
Thus, she started applying
our products to her face

195
and then used the rest of the expensive
product on her behind and feet.

196
In terms of quality,
we are confident that

197
no other product
in the world can match it.

198
A number of people who used
the so-called luxury brands told me

199
that they didn't realize how great
our products were until they tried them.

This means that the quality
of cosmetic products

isn't based on how famous
or luxurious the brand is.

Now it is true that famous
cosmetic brands are of high quality.

However, these products tend
to have too many added costs.

is to cover advertising costs.

It also includes the shop
or department store fees.

you pay is wasted

on paying these expenses
rather being invested into the product.

Furthermore, too much money is spent
on making these containers.

At Atomy, we make
our containers clean and simple.

We didn't spend any extra
for gold plating.

211
Nothing extra was done
to these containers.

212
Thus, we didn't add
any extra costs to the price

213
and made the products
with only what's necessary.

214
Due to the low price
of these products,

215
there will be many people
who won't buy the products

216
because of their doubts and not
on the account of it being expensive.

217
So, just try
the product first.

218
If you aren't satisfied with it,
just bring it back

219
and the company will either exchange it for
a new product or give you a cash refund.

This will make it easier for you
when you do the business

221
because you can confidently
tell others to try it

222
and if they don't like it,
they can return back to you.

223
When you really try
our products,

224
all of you are experts
who can determine

225
whether you should
continue to use it

226
and if it is a product
you can tell others about.

227
Please raise your hand
if you don't think you can do this.

228
You are all experts because you use
these kinds of products every day.

229
For those of you
who are here,

I know that some of you
came as consumers

231
because you like the products
and wanted to learn more.

232
A bigger number of you came
because you heard you can earn money

233
and wanted to see
if you could do this business.

234
As such, I believe
many of you are here

235
because you don't know
if you should do this business.

236
To decide whether or not
you should do this business,

237
you need to determine if the business
will work at the fundamental level.

238
This has to be the key factor
in your decision.

239
Instead of giving in to your emotions
or your simple desire to make money,

you must make a rational decision
with your 'Cool Head'.

241
You are the only person
who can determine

242
whether or not
the business will work.

243
There is a fundamental principle
that makes this business work.

244
All the products
that we carry

245
are daily necessities
that we all use every day.

246
Even if you didn't have money,
you would use these products.

247
These products will sell
even in bad economic times.

248
You don't have to worry about them
not selling due to a recession.

249
Now, would you not brush your teeth
if you were in financial difficulties?

No matter how much
debt you are in,

251
you would still brush your teeth
and wash your hair.

252
These products aren't affected
by the economy and will sell.

253
As long as these daily necessities
are of the highest quality

254
and sold at the lowest price,
the business will always work.

255
So how do you determine
the quality of the product?

256
You can figure this out
by using the product.

257
Since all of you are
expert consumers,

258
you will be able to quickly determine
if you will continue to use it or not

259
and how it compared to
what you have been using.

Although you might not be
expert manufacturers,

261
you are a specialist when it comes
to selecting products as a consumer.

262
You might not be able
to analyze the production costs

263
but you do have the ability
to sense and determine

264
whether the price is
too expensive or affordable.

265
Using the expert knowledge that
you have, as professional consumers,

266
you can determine
if these products will sell or not

267
and that conclusion you make
will be the most accurate.

268
You have to trust it.
 

269
Just try the product
and see for yourself.

You will understand everything
about the product once you use it.

271
If products
that everyone uses

272
is of the highest quality
and of the lowest price, will it sell?

273
Of course it will!
It would be bizarre if it didn't.

274
Fundamentally,
it's a sure thing.

275
We have one condition
when we select products at Atomy.

276
If someone brings us
a special or unique item,

277
we have not
and will not carry it.

278
If someone brings
something special and says,

279
It's nothing like you've ever seen
before," I won't even look at it.

So please don't recommend
anything that is unique

281
because
I will ignore it.

282
Then what catches
my interest?

283
Products that
everyone can use.

284
Products that seem ordinary
but we all use every day.

285
The toothpaste and toothbrush
are the most common.

286
Cosmetics
are normal as well.

287
There aren't unique because you can
find these products anywhere.

288
If these products
are great and low-priced,

289
there is no such thing as failure
because it's a sure thing.

Yet, if you try to sell something
that the world hasn't seen,

291
I don't know if it will
do well or not unless I try.

292
With so many people
who do the Atomy business

293
and put their life
and livelihood on the line,

294
I don't want
to add any more risk

295
by trying to sell products
that have uncertain futures.

296
Instead, by carrying products
that everyone uses every day,

297
where our quality of life
would be lowered

298
if we didn't use it for a day,
and selling them at the lowest price

299
with the highest quality,
is the safest route to go.

That's how you can
get rid of the risk.

There is no danger in that
but it's only possible with talent.

Atomy has the ability to make
our products number 1 in quality.

We can become number 1
in terms of structure as well.

As such, we always talk
about 'Absolute Quality',

which means that the quality
can't get any better.

You might wonder, "How Atomy can
always carry 'Absolute Quality' products

and stay number 1 when it's common
for other companies to try

and develop technologies
to surpass each other."

How can you say
that Atomy is number 1

and state that you only carry
'Absolute Quality' products?"

311
Well,
I state this boldly

312
because we don't
develop the technologies

313
and we don't manufacture
our products.

314
What does that mean?
 

315
We are able
to freely select

316
other businesses that have
the highest quality products

317
and the best technology
at any time.

318
That's how we will
become number 1.

319
Although there are a lot businesses,
we will only select those

who have the lowest production cost
and are number 1 in terms of quality.

321
If we continue like this,
we will be number 1.

322
Of course, Atomy will one day
do our own manufacturing

323
but we are only doing this
because we have a reason to do so.

324
Currently, we are doing some things
to help the people around us,

325
but when I see people
who are disabled or handicapped

326
forced to stay at home
and given everything,

327
I feel a little sting
in my heart.

328
I want to provide them
a system

329
where they can get out
and become more active.

Those are some of
the concerns I have.

331
I want to create a place for people
where those who are disabled

332
or are weaker members
of society can work.

333
I am always
thinking about this.

334
Since we usually refer
to ourselves as a social enterprise,

335
I think it is necessary
to strategically start researching ways

336
that we can give back
and help society.

337
Instead of just giving
to people in need,

338
I believe that we need
to create a system

339
where these people
can come out on their own

to become self-reliant
and help each other

341
so that we can all stand together
with our arms around each other's shoulder.

342
By doing so, we will be able
to feel pride in the way we live.

343
If you really think about
the phrase "Cherish the spirit,"

344
which is the first part
of our motto,

345
we need to consider the person's
mentality when helping others

346
and provide a base
where we can all be companions.

347
Rather than focusing
on making profit,

348
as long as we can
maintain the business,

349
I think it is important to invest
ourselves in making this possible.

Thus, once the welfare
system is created,

351
I was thinking of using some of
the funds to build factories

352
and invest it in other areas
to make this happen,

353
but I realized that
this could be difficult

354
as the goal of a factory
is to make profit.

355
As we do not manufacture
our own products,

356
we are able to have
the highest quality product,

357
which are of
'Absolute Quality',

358
because we are able
to truly select the best

359
and become number 1
by doing business with them.

Atomy has plans
to do this on a global level

361
rather than just selecting business
in the domestic market.

362
For example, we won't just sell Korean
products to the US, Canada, and Japan.

363
We will also get Japanese products
and sell them in Korea, US, and Canada.

364
Furthermore, we will sell
Japanese products in Japan as well.

365
Another example
of what we are planning

366
is buying products in South America
and selling them globally.

367
Each of the products
we carry at Atomy,

368
we seek to have products
that are of 'Absolute Quality'

369
that no one else
will be able to reach.

Now what does
the word 'Absolute' mean?

371
Well, when I was
in the military,

372
I was a field wire-man
that set up telephone lines.

373
If you want
to install telephone lines,

374
you need to climb
tall telephone poles.

375
Although it is set up
on the ground sometimes,

376
generally you have to
climb up the pole with spurs

377
and then use a belt
to support your weight.

378
I did that in the military
for about 3 years.

379
When I was there, they used
to hold divisional and corps

artillery gunnery
pole climbing competitions.

381
Since I was in the artillery division,
I had to participate in these events.

382
The competition was
to see who would be able

383
to climb up the pole
in the fastest time.

384
Generally, you would
have to either

385
hang your hat or do something
at the top of these telephone poles.

386
If you're a sergeant, you can
do this in about 12 to 13 seconds.

387
If you're a private
or corporal,

388
you should be able
to do it in 18 seconds.

389
I began to wonder how fast
I could climb up and down the pole

if I were to do it
at the best of my abilities.

391
Since this was
a competition,

392
everyone in the other divisions
would do their best as well,

393
so I need to estimate
what the fastest possible time was

394
and I did this by placing
the pole on the ground horizontally

395
and then doing
a shuttle run.

396
Between doing a shuttle run
with the pole on the ground

397
and climbing up and down
the same pole,

398
which one would have
the fastest time?

399
No one on this planet would be
able to climb the pole faster

than a person who did a shuttle run
along the length of the pole.

Since there is no one
who can climb it faster

than a person
who does the shuttle run,

trying to achieve that time
becomes an 'Absolute Goal'.

Thus, you might be able
to climb as fast as the person

who did the shuttle run
by doing the best you can

but no one can go any faster,
which makes it an 'Absolute Goal'.

After laying the pole on the ground
and doing the shuttle run,

I think it was 3.6
or 3.8 seconds.

so please bear with me.

I actually climbed a tree because
people asked if I could really do it.

411
My belly wasn't that big
when I was younger.

412
The picture makes me look heavy
but I was pretty small back then.

413
Anyway, I set that as my goal
and started practicing.

414
With hard work, I was able
to match the time.

415
Now, is there anyone in the world
who could beat that 3.8 seconds?

416
There was no one.
 

417
Yet, I was able to achieve
because I set that goal.

418
As such, having a goal
that no one in this world

419
both fundamentally and theoretically,
could humanly surpass

is what we call
an 'Absolute Goal'.

421
This kind of
'Absolute Goal',

422
where products are
of 'Absolute Quality'

423
and set at an 'Absolute Price'
can only be found at Atomy.

424
Unless the current
network marketing industry

425
is thoroughly concerned
about trying

426
to justifiably compete with
the other distribution channels,

427
this kind of business
will lose its place in the future.

428
Consumers
are not without thought.

429
Furthermore, the government
officials and bureaucrats aren't dense.

It might be difficult
to create just any regulations

431
but as time goes by, they will be
able to differentiate everything.

432
If restrictions
are put into place

433
and the consumers
do not welcome this industry,

434
the network marketing business
will eventually lose ground.

435
Most of the MLM
businesses until now

436
have always played a game
for their own benefit.

437
They claim that
the products are great

438
but most of these items
are very expensive.

439
Whether the company is from
the US or Korea, they are all the same.

Since the establishment of Atomy,
we have never considered

441
the other MLM companies,
the door-to-door sales,

442
and similar companies in
the industry as our competitors.

443
They have been excluded
from our list of rivals.

444
Instead, we consider other distribution
channels as our opponents.

445
I believed that if our products
weren't better and priced lower

446
than those you can find at discount stores,
TV home shopping networks,

447
and online shopping malls,
we wouldn't last.

448
Atomy is a network
marketing company.

449
Due to various situation
incurred by other MLM companies,

people have been
criticizing this industry

451
and society still has a negative
stigma about network marketing.

452
As a result, many people do not
wish to do this business.

453
I didn't want to be like
those MLM companies.

454
I had a lot of experience
in the manufacturing industry.

455
When I was a salaried worker,
my job was to create car parts

456
with engineering plastic
for about 17 years.

457
In 1992, I learned about
the MLM business in Australia

458
and I thought it was the most
beautiful kind of marketing ever.

459
I couldn't see
any problems with it

because you would use
great and low-priced products

461
and then inform the people
around you about it.

462
Instead of spending
money on advertising,

463
the person who introduced
the products to others

464
via word-of-mouth marketing
would be compensated.

465
I saw no flaw in using products
that were great and low-priced

466
as well as contributing back to
the consumers by compensating them.

467
When I returned to Korea,
people were participating

468
in various pyramid
schemes at the time

469
that caused problems
for a number of people.

I didn't want to be
a part of such a business.

471
When my wife told me
to stop doing the MLM business,

472
I really wanted
to stop doing it then.

473
Yet, I had this lingering attachment
in the back of my head

474
for the network marketing
that I knew.

475
In the books, the MLM business
was very charming and perfect.

476
Yet, in the real world,
it didn't follow what the books said.

477
I started looking for a company
that followed the textbooks

478
and the theories that I saw,
but I couldn't find one.

479
In the end, I wanted
to create the company myself

and if it didn't work, I would
forget the concept in its entirety.

481
I really wanted to start an MLM company
that followed the theories in the book.

482
It was very insignificant
in the beginning.

483
If the company could
fundamentally grow bigger

484
by means of carrying
daily necessities

485
that were of high quality and low price,
there was no way it would fail.

486
I started this company
believing that

487
it would grow only bigger
even if it started small.

488
Moreover, I didn't see
the other MLM companies

489
and the door-to-door sales
as our competitions.

Instead, if we could compete
with other distribution channels

491
like discount stores, TV home shopping,
and online shopping malls

492
by providing better quality
products at lower prices,

493
then there was a reason
for us to exist in distribution.

494
Yet, if that wasn't possible,
then there would be no point.

495
The company that I started with
the desire to truly emulate

496
the network marketing company
that I read in books was Atomy.

497
I believed it would work
as long as it followed the principles.

498
Trees begin as tiny seeds
that will continue to grow

499
as long as it receives water,
fertilizer, and sunlight.

They inevitably become big by following
something simple like the 'Laws of Nature'.

Likewise, if a product is a daily necessity,
high quality, and affordable,

there is no reason
for the item not to sell.

I believe that as long as people
who didn't have jobs

desired to do this business,
it would definitely grow.

If that were the case,
this would undoubtedly work.

So, I planted
that tiny seed.

I watered it, fed it,
and let it bask in the sun.

I began this company
with those feelings

and it has truly grown
at an alarming rate.

Atomy
has already started

511
making a name for itself
as network marketing company

512
and I believe that our role will
become that much more important.

513
Let's become a great MLM company
that goes down the right path

514
by following our vision
and principles.

515
Atomy has already begun
its journey as model company.

516
We have already begun changing
the network marketing industry in Korea

517
and will continue to become
a leader in that regards.

518
I hope that it will change
the cultural aspects as well.

519
Even when we enter
the Japanese, American,

Southeast Asian, Chinese,
and European markets,

521
I believe that we will
be able to change

522
the cultural attributes
of network marketing.

523
We must do our best
to become more legitimate,

524
more ethical, and more conscientious
when doing this business

525
so that we can become an exemplary
company like the ones in the textbooks.

526
We must follow the principles
regarding the consumers' benefits.

527
Consumers should buy
the products for their benefit.

528
Although we are a newcomer
to the network marketing industry,

529
we need to hold on
to these new cultural contents

and become a conscientious
company for the people.

531
Since the history of network marketing
from now on will be written by Atomy,

532
I think it is necessary to start
proposing the standards

533
and that this will become
a reality in the near future.

534
I hope that all of you
 

535
will be able to live
successful lives with Atomy.

536
I will end on that note.
Thank you.

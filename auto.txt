The theme for this lecture is
'The Road to an Auto Sales Master'.

2
When you become
an Auto Sales Master,

3
you will be truly successful
in this company.

4
Again, you would become
completely successful.

5
This should be
your ultimate goal

6
as you yourself will have
to achieve it in the end.

7
The final goal which you have to
achieve through your own efforts

8
is a Sales Master, or
what we call an Auto Sales Master.

9
Once you become this,
 

you will get $2K to $4K a month
as commission.

11
You might think, "I was told I could

12
How can you say that I have to set
my ultimate goal at $2K to $4K?"

13
What I mean
by ultimate goal is,

14
this is the last goal that
you need to achieve by yourself.

15
Now the remainder
will be achieved automatically.

16
So if you want to
be a Diamond Master,

17
it will be difficult
to achieve this on your own.

18
Instead, you need to become
an Auto Sales Master.

19
Then, the people who can be
an Auto Sales Master

will inevitably start
to show up to work with you.

21
Once two of these people show up
for your left and right,

22
you will automatically move up
to become an 'Auto Diamond Master'.

23
Therefore, what you
need to do is

24
to set your final goal
as an Auto Sales Master.

25
So how do you become
an Auto Sales Master?

26
Well, you need to
achieve 2.5 million PVs

27
on both the left
and right side,

28
twice a month,
 

29
in other words, every 15 days.
 

The closings are done on the 15th
and the last day of the month.

31
So, each month, you need
5 million PVs on each side, right?

32
In order to be
an Auto Sales Master,

33
you must have
'Auto Consumers' in your lines.

34
Without Auto Consumers, it's
impossible to be an Auto Sales Master.

35
Then, what are the conditions
of Auto Consumers?

36
First, they should be educated
to be able to register by themselves.

37
Instead of doing everything for them.
teach them how to register themselves.

38
As long as the person has some knowledge
about the computer or the internet,

39
teach and guide them
instead of doing it for them.

Now if the person knows nothing about
those things, of course, you need to help them.

41
But in general, people should learn
how to register by themselves.

42
Next, they should have
knowledge about our products.

43
Third, they should have hands-on
experience with the product.

44
This product is really good.
 

45
I want to use this product
for the rest of my life."

46
Which means they should purchase
the products by themselves.

47
This does not mean you take
the orders and deliver the product.

48
Of course, there may be
some people who need that.

49
Yet, a perfect Auto Consumer
would be a person

who purchases the product
by oneself and uses it.

51
Regardless of
whether I know or not,

52
they should be able to make
purchases on their own.

53
To do so, we need to educate them
about our products, right?

54
We need to inform them
about how good our products are,

55
the consumers need
to actually use the products,

56
and then through their experience,
recognize that

57
This is the product I need for life
and purchase it by themselves.

58
From this point on, the person
can then become an Auto Consumer.

59
The next thing that
this person needs to do is...

Fifth, they should become a person who
introduces the products to others.

61
Once you train people who could do this,
these people can be Auto Consumers.

62
In other words, people who purchase
and use the products on their own,

63
then introduce
the products to others,

64
and finally, share the information,
are known as what?

65
They are 'Auto Consumers'.
 

66
We need to have these Auto Consumers
on my left and right.

67
Then how many
would we need to find?

68
Generally, when one consumer
uses our products,

69

For example, one cosmetic set
can be used for 2~3 months.

71
At the exclusive distributor price,

72
And if they consume a box of
HemoHIM in a month,

73
that will make

74
If we add up all
the toothbrushes, toothpastes

75
and the other products,
that's a few thousand PVs added on.

76
The consumer
will use these products

77
but they have
other family members, right?

78
So the other family members
will also use the products as well.

79
Of course, there are cases where
only one woman lives in a house,

but some might have daughters, mothers,
or sisters who use them together.

81
On average,
a family would use one set.

82
Then, 4 sets are purchased
at an exclusive distributor price,

83

84
And if the family uses the other products,

85
So for each family...
 

86
once they have the product
knowledge and experience,

87
worth of products per month.

88
Let's say that you can get

89
So if you want 5 million PVs a month,
then how many people would you need?

 

91
I don't mean registered members.

92
I'm talking about those who are trained
and able to make purchases on their own.

93
Once you get these people,
you can be an Auto Sales Master.

94
you'll get 2.5 million PVs in 15 days.

95
This means that you can be
an Auto Sales Master.

96
However, these consumers
can make 6 million PVs this month,

97
but the next month they can
just make 4 million PVs, can't they?

98
Therefore, it is necessary
to have some room here.

99
So how about having

You would be able to continuously
be an Auto Sales Master.

on both sides,

under you that purchase the products,

you can become
an Auto Sales Master

who makes
$2K to $4K a month.

If you just get to this level,
you will be truly successful in Atomy.

If you were to make
$2K~$4K a month

even when you are
on vacation,

or checked in
at the hospital,

just by being
an Auto Sales Master,

would you want to quit?
You would continue to do it, right?

111
Actually, you will be enjoying the business
when you get to that point.

112
If people enjoy something,
do they continually talk about it?

113
Of course, they do.
 

114
Now, while you're making
$2K~$4K a month,

115
will your downlines be making nothing?
No, that is not the case.

116
Some of your downlines

117
while others could earn

118
A family's income

119
is an incredible feat.
If a change occurs, it would be something big.

on groceries a month,

121
your family could be
enjoying a feast.

122
Your quality of life
can change quite a lot.

123
Just with an increase

124
your house could
become bigger.

125
You can expand
your house a bit.

126
So will the people
in your downline

127
who are earning

128
head towards making
$2K~$4K as well?

129
They most certainly will
because it's fun.

It's not always good to earn
a lot of money at the beginning.

131
It's not like you have to go
to the office on time every day.

132
You're using
your time freely,

133
and you're not making
a major investment

134
or taking a major risk
with this business.

135
Who wouldn't enjoy
earning several hundred dollars?

136
Once you become
an Auto Sales Master,

137
things will automatically
come into place.

138
Now if you set
your goals too high,

139
you'll think,

What about a goal like,

141
Earn $2K to $4K
 

142
on each side."

143
Now if you hear that someone
has thousands on each side,

144
or even tens of
thousands on each side.

145
You'll think,
Wow, can I do that?

146
Numbers like this seem very far,

147
But when I look at you now, you look
uncomfortable even for that many.

148
However, there is a method

149
It's not difficult.
Why?


151
It would be difficult for me to find

152
You know what?
When I started this company,

153
I was the first one
to recruit people, right?

154
I had to find people
on my own.

155
I would tell them about
what the business was,

156
ask them to try the products,
and then asked them to work with me.

157
Then, how many people do you think
followed me after they heard me?

158
17 people?
No, it was less than 17.

159
I didn't recruit
all 17 people by myself.

For example, I only told
RM Jeong Soo Park,

161
who was the owner of
the failed Duck Soup restaurant.

162
Well, Mr. Kyu Jung Choi used to
supply food products to her place.

163
Now, who do you think recruited him?
Was it me or RM Jeong Soo Park?

164
Royal Master Jeong Soo Park
recruited him.

165
Even I couldn't recruit

166
There were so many people
who refused to come

167
even though I asked them
to come so earnestly.

168
I called hundreds
and hundreds of people,

169
telling them,
I am starting this business.

Please come
and try our products."

171
Yet, only several people
actually came.

172
Now these
5 to 6 people that came,

173
were the ones that recruited
all the other members.

174
So, when I tell you

175
I'm not saying to find

176
Once you start recruiting
out of the people you know

177
and even the people
you don't know,

178
will everyone just follow what you say?
No, they won't.

179
If a person just invested

do you think they will come if you ask?
No, they won't.

181
That person will never come until
he fails or has the time for it.

182
However, a lot
of people are like this:

183
you contemplate all night long
about telling them

184
and when you do,
they refuse it.

185
Then you'll think,
I knew this would happen.

186
The person didn't do this because
they had a reason not to do.

187
But you might think,
'This business is too hard."

188
Atomy isn't something
that everyone can do.

189
Think about it. Who will lead
the country? The schools?

In other words,
not everyone can do it.

191
There will be people
who need to do this business.

192
Our job is finding
those people.

193
And it becomes very tiring
when you try to persuade people.

194
So, don't agonize over it and just
let them know about it.

195
Just let them know.
Then, what happens?

196
People who are looking
for this will show up.

197
Now, the best way
to let them know is

198
inviting them
to the One-Day Seminars

199
or to the Success Academy.
 

Invite them by saying,
Why don't you listen to it?

If they ask
what this is all about,

don't try to
explain everything.

Just say, "I was
dumbfounded by the lectures."

I'm at a loss for words as
it was really something else."

Why don't you go
and find out about it?"

Find out whether it's worth doing.
After you go and listen,

if it's not worth doing,
then persuade me not to do it."

If you tell them to come
and decide about this together,

there will be people among them
who will think,

Wow, this is just
what I've been looking for."

211
So, while you might be
just interested about it,

212
there will be people
who are completely into it.

213
And among those people,
 

214
there will be some with
completely unexpected outcomes.

215
Even they themselves
won't know it.

216
They will be the ones who never believed
that this could work so well.

217
It means that there are people
who have untapped potential

218
that wasn't discovered before.
 

219
However, when they found
the Atomy business, it just poured out...

I heard this story:
 

221
Someone thought, "I will try to be
the first person to arrive at the office."

222
So he went to the office
early in the morning

223
and found that everyone
was already there.

224
The next morning, he arrived an hour earlier
only to find people were there.

225
He thought, "Wow,
people must come really early."

226
The following morning, he came even earlier,
but there were still people.

227
He then asked,
What time are you guys coming?

228
They answered,
We didn't go home last night.

229
It means they worked
all night long.

Like these workers,
 

231
you have to be really passionate
at times to be successful.

232
There needs to be
fire burning in your eyes.

233
Once you do,
success becomes easier.

234
Sometimes, there are
people who think,

235
I don't know
whether I can make it."

236
Anyway, let's find out
whether someone will do it."

237
Let's talk to others as well
and see if they'll do it."

238
These people might act and talk
like this, but with a stroke of luck,

239
they come upon
a wonderful person.

You know,
people often think

241
that they need to be good at
whatever they do.

242
So they think, "I'm not good at this,
I'm not good at that..."

243
and take it
upon themselves.

244
But actually, in terms of success,
one's own ability is less than 1 %.

245
You don't become successful through
your own personal connections.

246
How many people do you think you'll know
if thousands of people were gathered?

247
There are
so many people here

248
but how many of you did I know
before I started this company?

249
Not that many.
 

There are a few
thousand people here

251
but I only
know a handful.

252
Everyone here is connected
to somebody who

253
knew someone and so on
until it came back to me.

254
Therefore, you will
not be successful just with

255
all the people you know
or your ability alone.

256
So, if you have the ability
 

257
you should definitely
do this business. Why?

258
Don't sell your ability short
by getting a monthly salary.

259
Rather, do this business
and make it big.

And for those who feel
they don't have any ability,

261
you should do
this business as well. Why?

262
What else will you do
without any ability?

263
You can't make
a living with anything else.

264
So if you think you don't
have any abilities,

265
you have to do Atomy.
 

266
Let's say you are
a half-smarter.

267
Generally, you would be surrounded
by more half-smarters.

268
A half-smarter here
and here,

269
and next to them
are more half-smarters.

As this continues down
with half-smarters,

271
you'll come across
a full-smarter.

272
This person might think,
Wow, what a wonderful business.

273
The full-smarters
not only has abilities

274
but they also have
a big personal network.

275
Some of these full-smarters
could be an international player.

276
Anyway, if you do the Atomy business,
you will certainly be successful.

277
What do you have to do?
You just keep at it,

278
until you come across
one of these full-smarters.

279
Did you know that if Native Americans
do a rain dance, it always rains?

It's because they don't stop
the rain dance until it rains.

281
Now, we shouldn't predict
or prejudge

282
if a person will or will not
do this business.

283
In legal terms,
they call it prejudication.

284
For example,
let's say someone looks like a thief.

285
If this person
went to court for trial,

286
they would generally
be charged with the crime.

287
A study was conducted
to see

288
what would happen
to beautiful women.

289
Generally, these women had lower penalties
than less attractive women.

They had a higher probability
of having a 'not guilty' verdict.

291
Why? Most of the judges
were males

292
who prejudged that
such beautiful women

293
couldn't commit such atrocities,
 

294
and believed
that they wouldn't.

295
So, they concluded that
these women were 'not guilty'.

296
Hence, you shouldn't predict
whether or not someone will do this.

297
That is something that
the people will decide on their own.

298
This is known as
the 'Law of Own Mind'.

299
Let's say it together.
The Law of Own Mind.

Who decides if they will do something?
They themselves will.

After agonizing all night,
 

you finally resolve to tell someone,
hoping that they will do it,

only to hear, "What the heck
happened to you?"

There are people like this.
 

Or you might think, "This person won't do it...
I guess it won't hurt to tell them."

And they could respond,
This is what I was looking for.

Again, who decides whether to do it or not?
They do.

And whose mind decides to tell them?
Your mind does.

Once you understand
the 'Law of Own Mind',

you will become
a master of sales.

311
You won't have any troubles
or difficulties with the work.

312
Then, what do people
agonize over?

313
What should I say?
 

314
How will they feel
if I talk about it?"

315
These are the questions
they lose sleep over.

316
Then they would wake up and think,
Doing sales is so hard.

317
They haven't done anything
 

318
and were already
worrying over

319
what the other person
would think about.

Truthfully, doing that
doesn't help with any business.

321
Don't worry about
what the other person will think.

322
Just talk to them first
 

323
because the person should
be the one agonizing over it.

324
If you don't
tell them about it

325
and just worry about what
the person will do would be of no use.

326
Instead, just talk
to everyone.

327
Don't agonize over it,
just tell people.

328
Even the Bible states,
Make the most of the opportunity.

329
So, just talk to others
without thinking.

Then who will be troubled?
The person you told.

331
This way you will know
whether or not they will do it.

332
However, if you don't tell them
and just worry about it yourself,

333
all you're doing is
wasting time and energy.

334
Therefore, the best way
to be efficient

335
is to invite the person
to a seminar

336
and don't be troubled
with how they will decide.

337
Just say, "Let's go."
 

338
If the person answers no,
then that's that.

339
Will you not succeed
because of that one person?

Is that person
the only one left in the world?

341
You can talk to people you know
or even people you don't know.

342
All you have to do
is tell them.

343
That's why you should
just talk to anybody.

344
Just throw it out there.
 

345
If someone shows interest,
then you can tell them.

346
If not,
just forget about it.

347
Why?
Because there are so many people.

348
When you keep on talking
with ease like this,

349
and when you tell someone,
Let's to go a Success Academy,

just like there are some
who will never come,

351
there are others who are
eager to receive an invitation.

352
These people are just
itching to do something.

353
So, when you invite them
to go somewhere,

354
they will just follow you
because they wanted to get out.

355
Many of you are here
for the same reason.

356
But these people
are stunned after listening.

357
There were cases
when someone just tagged along

358
and then later
became a big fish.

359
Anyway, after it is conveyed
one way or another,

it will get to where
it needs to go.

361
Whose mind decides what to do?
That person's mind.

362
Whose decision is it to tell them?
Your own.

363
All you have to do
is just keep on talking.

364
This has actually
become a habit of mine.

365
When I go to a restaurant,
after finishing the meal, I just talk.

366
I'd say, "Madam, I sell cosmetics."
She'd ask, "What cosmetics do you sell?"

367
I sell Atomy Cosmetics.
It was developed by KAERI."

368
and people are crazy about it."

369
But the price is less than
half the cost of most."

People who used luxury cosmetics just
threw it away because they preferred ours."

371
I just talk like that.
Now how long did that take?

372
17 seconds.
 

373
Some people will respond.
 

374
They'd say,
I heard about it before.

375
And ask,
How do I buy it?

376
Then you can start
talking from there.

377
Some people won't have
any thoughts about it.

378
In this case,
you can just leave.

379
However, you should talk about it
again the next time you go.

There was a restaurant near
the office we were at before.

381
I would often eat there.
 

382
I told her to try our cosmetics

383
So I said, "You're really
not going to try our cosmetics?"

384
I might not come back
if you don't."

385
Maybe next time,
I'll pay you with our cosmetics."

386
I ended with,
Well? What will you do?

387
She answered, "Fine, I'll try it."
And that was how I sold one.

388
Anyway, it's necessary
to continually bring it up.

389
Just think about it.
 

After someone mentions something,
will people just go, "Oh wow, I'll buy it"?

391
That hardly ever happens.
Most of the time,

392
they say they won't buy it,
but it will be in the back of their minds.

393
As they are about to forget,
you bring it up again.

394
This time, they might
research about it on the internet.

395
And let's say they hear about it
from someone else.

396
If you didn't know
the word Atomy,

397
even if someone talked about it,
you wouldn't understand or remember it.

398
But if you heard about Atomy and
someone said, "Atomy cosmetics are great,"

399
you might think,
Wait, someone told me about it.

At that point,
it's ingrained in your mind.

The person, who didn't listen
when you told them it is good,

after hearing
from someone else,

might say, "Can I see the cosmetics
you talked about before?"

So you need to take
every opportunity and just talk.

You need to be talkative.
 

There are people who have words
just spinning around inside their heads.

If your personality is like this,
don't try to change it as it won't be easy.

Instead, the people
you should look for,

especially if you're
a person of few words,

would be the ones
who are talkative.

411
If you feel you can't go around
since you are old,

412
then recruit someone
who is young and has strong legs.

413
You can send this youth
to run around all over the place.

414
If you think, "Things aren't
connecting in my head,"

415
or "I can't understand a word,"
 

416
then find a person who can
and make them your downline.

417
Now, the marketing plan
of our company

418
is constructed in such a way
that the commissions you receive

419
will be the same whether the sales
are made in my direct downline


421
It is designed so that even
an incapable person can succeed.

422
You can be successful,
even if you're a half-smarter.

423
Why? In general, half-smarters
are surround by other half-smarters,

424
who are surrounded
by other half-smarters,

425
who are surrounded by...
Even if it continues down like this,

426
as long as
a full-smarter appears,

427
regardless of how far
down the line,

428
the commission will come to you
without any limitations.

429
This plan is not only applied in Korea,
but even if it spreads to the U.S.,

to Japan, back to Korea,
back to the U.S., and to Canada,

431
it's designed so that the commissions
from all the sales will come back to you.

432
It is designed
to allow you to do that.

433
If you're in the U.S.,
you'll buy products from the U.S. branch

434
and if you're in Korea,
you'll buy products in Korea.

435
Whether your partners buy products
in Korea, Japan, or in the U.S.,

436
the total commissions
will be added up and given to you.

437
It's a plan that's very simple for you
and very complicated for the company.

438
Essentially,
if you make up your mind

439
to become an Auto Sales Master
at Atomy,

all you will have to do
is get there.

441
To become
an Auto Sales Master,

442
you need to have

443
on your left and
right side.

444
But you're not going to find

445
As long as you find 1 or 2,
maybe even 3 or 4 people,

446
then those people will also
find a similar number of consumers

447
 

448
if some Auto Consumers

449
also desire to become
Auto Sales Masters,

then you will move up
to a Diamond Master.

451
Once those SMs become DMs,
you'll go up to a Sharon Rose Master.

452
Now earning

453
seem like a dream
that's far away,

454
but as long as you become
an Auto Sales Master,

455
you will continually
move up in Mastership.

456
By achieving each new Mastership,
this system will help you

457
get closer to the balanced life
you're striving for

458
and allow you
to become truly successful.

459
I'll end on that note.
Thank you very much.
